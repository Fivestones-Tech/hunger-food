# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I deleted everything in the app.jsx file then recreated it using the short code sheet 'rafce'

i remove the app.css styling then create the first styling needed to start the project

i change the title name

Next
i created the componebts folder for all our components 
Pages folder for all our pages

Inside my component folder i created a navbar file and Css file

I open the navbar.jsx file the imported the Navbar css file for styling the navbar specifically

To start creating the navbar component i need to mount it in my app.js file
In that way our navbar component as been added into the app components

I added all the assets needed to start the project in our source file

I'm starting to build my navigation bar

i create a state variable to achieve that
i used the useState to achieve that coming from react
